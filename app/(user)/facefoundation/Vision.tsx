            FACE Foundation is a visionary initiative led by eminent
            educationists in Kerala, India. For over two decades, our foundation
            has taken revolutionary strides in enhancing academic performance
            since its inception in 2009. Through impactful educational and
            developmental activities, FACE Foundation has consistently made
            waves in society.

            Under the leadership of Mr. E Yacoob Faizy, founding Secretary, FACE
            Foundation initially launched the Farooqu Model Residential School,
            aimed at nurturing young talents for competitive examinations from
            an early age. This initiative marked the beginning of a
            transformative educational approach that integrates rigorous
            academic training with moral and leadership education.

            Over the years, FACE has expanded its reach and scope, establishing
            FACE Campus, which later evolved into FACE World Leadership School.
            This institution has become a crucible for cultivating future
            leaders and civil servants through a focused, comprehensive
            curriculum that emphasises competitive success and societal impact.

            Still, its journey is continuing. In 2024, FACE Foundation
            established FACE IAS Academy in Trivandrum, a residential civil
            service academy (RCA) offering fully funded scholarships to
            deserving aspirants.
